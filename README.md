## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- **Objective:** Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using demographic and ticketing information
- **Features Used:** Age, Sex, Passenger Class, Fare, Embarkation Port, Family Size (SibSp + Parch)
- **Target:** Binary classification (Survived: Yes/No)

## ðŸ§ª Methods

- **Models Used:**
  - ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree
  - ðŸŒ² Random Forest
  - âš¡ XGBoost

- **Techniques Applied:**
  - ðŸ”¤ Label encoding for categorical features (Sex, Embarked)
  - ðŸ“Š MinMax scaling for numerical features
  - ðŸ§® Feature engineering and selection
  - ðŸ“‹ Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score
  - ðŸ“Š Confusion matrices for visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree | 82.12% | 0.83 | 0.82 | 0.81 |
| âš¡ XGBoost | 81.56% | 0.81 | 0.82 | 0.81 |
| ðŸŒ² Random Forest | 79.33% | 0.80 | 0.79 | 0.78 |

- **Key Insights:**
  - Decision Tree showed the best overall performance with 82.12% accuracy
  - All models demonstrated good balance between precision and recall
  - Models performed well in identifying both survivors and non-survivors
